abstract = {Differential geometry and topology have become essential tools for many theoretical physicists. In particular, they are indispensable in theoretical studies of condensed matter physics, gravity, and particle physics. Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition introduces the ideas and techniques of differential geometry and topology at a level suitable for postgraduate students and researchers in these fields. The second edition of this popular and established text incorporates a number of changes designed to meet the needs of the reader and reflect the development of the subject. The book features a considerably expanded first chapter, reviewing aspects of path integral quantization and gauge theories. Chapter 2 introduces the mathematical concepts of maps, vector spaces, and topology. The following chapters focus on more elaborate concepts in geometry and topology and discuss the application of these concepts to liquid crystals, superfluid helium, general relativity, and bosonic string theory. Later chapters unify geometry and topology, exploring fiber bundles, characteristic classes, and index theorems. New to this second edition is the proof of the index theorem in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The final two chapters are devoted to the most fascinating applications of geometry and topology in contemporary physics, namely the study of anomalies in gauge field theories and the analysis of Polakov's bosonic string theory from the geometrical point of view. Geometry, Topology and Physics, Second Edition is an ideal introduction to differential geometry and topology for postgraduate students and researchers in theoretical and mathematical physics.},

@article{Agricola2004,
abstract = {The present note deals with the dynamics of metric connections with vectorial torsion, as already described by E. Cartan in 1925. We show that the geodesics of metric connections with vectorial torsion defined by gradient vector fields coincide with the Levi-Civita geodesics of a conformally equivalent metric. By pullback, this yields a systematic way of constructing invariants of motion for such connections from isometries of the conformally equivalent metric, and we explain in as much this result generalizes the Mercator projection which maps sphere loxodromes to straight lines in the plane. An example shows that Beltrami's theorem fails for this class of connections. We then study the system of differential equations describing geodesics in the plane for vector fields which are not gradients, and show among others that the Hopf-Rinow theorem does also not hold in general.},
