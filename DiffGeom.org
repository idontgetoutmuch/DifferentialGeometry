* A General Relativity Bibliography

I started with cite:o1983semi which I still think is the best but
really quite hard going. It comes the closest to explaining what an
observer is. It stays away from overuse of indices. I think one only
needs to read chapters 1--6, 12 and 13.

For differential forms I read cite:darling_1994 but it doesn't cover
relativity.

These cite:tong-gr-lecture-notes are pretty good but I didn't really
follow his introductory chapter and skipped most of it. Maybe I could
now get more out of it. He doesn't say what an observer is but he does
use forms for some calculations instead of the raw curvature tensor to
make things easier.
